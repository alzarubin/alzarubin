Here’s a personalized GitHub profile description for you based on the information available:

👋 Hi, I’m @alzarubin
	•	👀 I’m interested in software development with a focus on Go and Java. I enjoy diving into concurrency patterns, performance optimization, and system architecture. My interests also extend to Kubernetes, Spring Boot, and cloud-native technologies.
	•	🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced caching mechanisms with Ehcache off-heap storage, optimizing database interactions via native queries, and integrating profiling tools like VisualVM and JMX for performance analysis. I’m also exploring prompt engineering techniques for LLMs and experimenting with new libraries in the AI/ML ecosystem.
	•	💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve building efficient, scalable systems. I’m particularly excited about contributing to open-source initiatives related to Go, cloud infrastructure, and backend performance optimization. If you’re working on something involving distributed systems, caching strategies, or advanced concurrency, let’s connect!
	•	📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via GitHub Issues or connect with me on LinkedIn.
	•	😄 Pronouns: He/Him
	•	⚡ Fun fact: I’m an avid fan of YouTube channels like Oksana MS and Life in France, which I find perfect for unwinding. When I’m not coding, you might find me exploring new concurrency techniques in Go or reading articles on Habr to stay updated with the latest tech trends.
